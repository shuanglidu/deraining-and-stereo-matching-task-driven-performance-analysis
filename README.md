Introduction

In this paper, we introduce a new image deraining dataset, called Rain-Kitti2012 and Rain-Kitti2015, which is created by adding rain part to clean images in KITTI2012 and KITTI2015. The dataset is the first dataset that can be used to perform stereo-matching-driven evaluation for deraining methods.

Dataset  

For each pair of left-right images in Kitti2012 and Kitti2015, three-level rain streaks (i.e. light, medium and heavy) are added following the additive rain model. And, the produced degraded images are named as “…_1.png” ，“…_2.png” and “…_3.png” respectively.
Users can download data of the above dataset from Baidu Cloud (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gaPk7QrzhfrPcBIUhgnTzw  extraction code:2022)
